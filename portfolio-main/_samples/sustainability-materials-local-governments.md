## Description

As part of a collaborative project in the University of Washington technical writing certificate program, I worked with two fellow cohort members to develop instructional, persuasive, and informative materials on environmental technology and sustainability. Our work was designed to support local government initiatives in Norfolk, VA; Redlands, CA; and Morrisville, NC, with a focus on improving public engagement and accessibility of information.

## Deliverables

- [Recycling Aid for Norfolk, VA]({{ "/PDF%20Downloads/Norfolk%20VA%20Aid.pdf" | relative_url }})  
  An infographic helping residents properly sort recyclables to reduce contamination and improve waste management efficiency.

- [Solar Panel Installation Proposal for Redlands, CA]({{ "/PDF%20Downloads/Redlands%20CA%20Proposal.pdf" | relative_url }})  
  A formal proposal advocating for municipal solar energy adoption.

- [Indoor Air Quality Fact Sheets for Morrisville, NC]({{ "/PDF%20Downloads/Morrisville%20NC%20Fact%20Sheets.pdf" | relative_url }})  
  A set of fact sheets detailing pollutant sources, air quality monitoring metrics, and mitigation techniques.

## Highlights

- Co-authored a series of technical documents tailored to public audiences and local government stakeholders.
- Designed clear, structured content with visual aids to enhance comprehension and usability.
- Applied technical writing best practices to support environmental sustainability efforts.
