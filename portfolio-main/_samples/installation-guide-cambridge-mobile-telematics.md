## Description

This is a speculative documentation sample: a QR-first installation guide concept for the DriveWell Tag, a BLE telematics device typically mounted to a vehicle and paired with a smartphone app for trip capture. The guide is designed as a mobile-optimized web deliverable (HTML + CSS + JavaScript), allowing a driver to scan a QR code from packaging and immediately launch a step-by-step installation flow on their phone.

The experience includes a step-by-step wizard mode with progress tracking, expandable callouts for placement guidance and safety notes, embedded checklists to reduce missed prerequisites, micro-troubleshooting based on common symptoms (for example, tag not appearing or trips not recording), and language plus accessibility controls (text size, high contrast, reduced motion). The goal is to reduce install friction while improving verification and recovery when setup fails.

## Process

I began by reviewing existing product documentation and researching the product's controls, limitations, and feedback mechanisms. I then consulted a subject matter expert to validate assumptions about the device/app pairing workflow and identify the highest-impact troubleshooting paths.

Based on that research, I produced a first draft as a static PDF centered on task-based steps, verification checkpoints, and progressive disclosure. Finally, I translated the draft into the web deliverable using prompt-engineering workflows with ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking and Opus 4.5 in Claude Code. The next step would be user testing in real-world conditions to validate the flow and recovery paths.

## Highlights

- Structured content into a task-based, step-by-step flow with verification checkpoints and progressive disclosure.
- Added micro-troubleshooting paths tied to common setup failures (permissions, pairing delays, placement/connection issues).
- Designed for accessibility and localization with user-controlled reading modes and language toggles.
- Used SME consultation to validate workflow assumptions and prioritize the highest-impact support content.
