# About

I am a data-driven technical communicator who views writing as a technology and technology as applied philosophy. Working with AI means working with a new technology of the written word, which in turn involves thinking critically about our world. As technologies become more general-purpose, users will need more generalizable sets of skills and knowledge to use them effectively. 

I have experience developing educational materials and job aids tailored for computer science majors, data annotators, and AI developers. I am interested in creating accessible and engaging documentation for technical audiences, and I also enjoy crafting instructional content and interactive documentation that empowers end users. My workflow often involves combining structured writing with visual elements to facilitate knowledge transfer across domains.

Driven by curiosity, I am especially excited about projects that explore the intersection of technology, creativity, and systems thinking. I aim to contribute to projects that not only communicate technical details but also bridge the gap between theory and practice. 

If you're looking for someone who combines attention to detail with a strategic approach to content creation, feel free to reach out. Great ideas emerge from strong collaboration!
