# About Me

I am a data-driven technical communicator who understands writing as a technology and technology as applied philosophy. As technologies become more general-purpose, users will need more generalizable sets of skills and knowledge to apply them.

I am proficient in tools like Markdown, HTML/CSS, GitHub, and JSON. I also have experience developing job aids and educational materials tailored for computer science majors, data annotators, and AI developers.

My expertise lies in creating accessible and engaging documentation for technical audiences such as developers and deployers. I also enjoy crafting instructional content and interactive documentation that empowers end users and facilitates seamless adoption of tools and technologies. My workflow often involves combining structured writing with visual elements to facilitate knowledge transfer.

Driven by curiosity, I am especially excited about projects that explore the intersection of technology, creativity, and systemic thinking. I aim to contribute to projects that not only communicate technical details but also bridge the gap between theory and practice. 

If you're looking for someone who combines attention to detail with a strategic approach to content creation, please reach out! Great ideas emerge from strong collaboration, and I look forward to collaborating with you.
