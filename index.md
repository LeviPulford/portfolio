## Player's Manual to Generative AI Standards
![Thumbnail for Sample 1]()
Please contact me for a copy.

**Role:** Author 

**Description:** I created a 29-page concept of operations, or ConOps, framed as a player's manual to aid emerging AI and data science professionals. It includes resources for navigating technical standards in generative AI and applies governance frameworks to widely taught concepts in computer science and machine learning, such as tokens and transformers. By framing the contents as a player's manual, this document leverages prior knowledge of games to facilitate knowledge transfer about AI. It also remains politically neutral, in that it does not call for or critique either regulatory or deregulatory approaches. Instead, it emphasizes the voluntary nature of standards. Additionally, this ConOps applies two forms of reasoning—reasoning with first principles and reasoning with analogy—to help those working in AI and data create ethical mental models of their work.

**Tools:** Microsoft Word, Google Slides, Adobe InDesign

**Highlights:**
* Authored a detailed guide that synthesizes complex concepts into accessible and actionable content.
* Developed visual aids and workflows to illustrate technical processes and enhance usability.
* Addressed emerging industry needs by outlining best practices for ethical and practical AI development.

**Role:** Writing Center Associate  

**Description:** At Amherst College, I co-facilitated a staff-led workshop titled "An Aspiring Ornithologist and a Stochastic Parrot Walk into a Writing Center" during the 2024 AI in the Liberal Arts (AILA) undergraduate research conference. This workshop offered observations on student agency and AI in writing before inviting participants to explore the impact of artificial intelligence on writing. Activities included creating imaginative documents and data visualizations to identify opportunities and challenges when integrating AI into the writing process. The workshop also highlighted interdisciplinary insights into how AI reshapes writing pedagogies, practices, and the evolving relationship between humans and technology.  

**Tools:** Google Slides, ChatGPT, Poll Everywhere  

**Highlights:**  
* Designed and facilitated interactive activities that encouraged critical and creative thinking about AI in writing.  
* Engaged an interdisciplinary audience in discussions that bridged liberal arts, pedagogy, and artificial intelligence.  
* Co-created imaginative resources with participants, including data visualizations and collaborative documents, to capture key workshop insights.

**Role:** Contributor 

**Description:** I was invited by the chair of the ACM special interest group Computers and Society (SIGGCAS) to contribute a "quick-take" op-ed for the September 2023 newsletter. My piece, titled "'All Watched Over By Machines': AI Ethics, Surveillance, and Pluralism," explores the social and ethical consequences of AI and surveillance technologies, advocating for pluralistic approaches to technological governance. This work reflects SIGCAS's mission to raise awareness about the societal impact of technology.  

**Tools:** Microsoft Word  

**Highlights:**  
* Solicited to write an op-ed for a respected ACM publication, demonstrating recognition of my expertise in AI ethics and communication.  
* Engaged an interdisciplinary audience of computer scientists, ethicists, and policymakers with accessible yet nuanced discussion.  
* Addressed critical ethical challenges at the intersection of AI, surveillance, and societal diversity, aligning with SIGCAS's mission.

## <a href="https://www.umass.edu/writing-program/chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toolkit for Teaching Writing in the Age of ChatGPT</a> 
![Thumbnail for Sample 4](thumbnails/Teaching Writing Screenshot.jpg)

**Role:** Graduate Assistant Director for Teacher Training  

**Description:** For the UMass Amherst Writing Program, I co-developed the "Teaching Writing in the Age of ChatGPT" webpage for instructors during the 2022-2023 academic year. This resource equips educators with theoretically informed strategies to adapt to the challenges and opportunities posed by AI in writing pedagogy. My primary contribution was the section on Scholarly Roots for Writing Studies' Best Practices, which highlights foundational research in process pedagogy, critical self-reflection, and writing-to-learn strategies. Much of this research was work I had accumulated over 15 credits of graduate-level courses in composition and rhetoric. The webpage continues to serve instructors across first-year writing, junior-year writing, and writing-across-the-disciplines courses.  

**Tools:** Google Docs  

**Highlights:**  
* Strategized content for the "Scholarly Roots" section, grounding contemporary teaching practices in foundational research.  
* Contributed to a resource that aligns theoretical frameworks with practical strategies for writing instruction in the context of AI.  
* Collaborated with educators and administrators to curate content that addresses diverse teaching needs, resulting in a widely shared resource within the university community.

**Role:** Editorial Assistant and Social Media Lead  

**Description:** [Paperbark Magazine](https://www.paperbarkmag.org) bridges science, culture, and sustainability, promoting interdisciplinary thinking and intergenerational collaboration to address critical environmental and societal issues. In Fall 2021, I contributed to the publication of the third printed issue, a project rooted in themes of stewardship, innovation, and possibility. In this role, I collaborated with writers, editors, graphic designers, and scientists to refine content that aligned with the magazine’s mission to illuminate the environmental humanities. Additionally, I developed print and digital assets, managed social media and campus communications, and contributed to a 2x increase in submissions for the following issue.
