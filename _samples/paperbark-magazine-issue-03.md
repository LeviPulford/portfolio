## Description

[Paperbark Magazine](https://www.paperbarkmag.org) bridges science, culture, and sustainability, promoting interdisciplinary thinking and intergenerational collaboration to address critical environmental and societal issues. In Fall 2021, I contributed to the publication of the third printed issue, a project rooted in themes of stewardship, innovation, and possibility.

In this role, I collaborated with writers, editors, graphic designers, and scientists to refine content aligned with the magazine's mission to illuminate the environmental humanities. I also developed print and digital assets, managed social media and campus communications, and contributed to a twofold increase in submissions for the following issue.

## Highlights

- Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to produce a cohesive and impactful publication.
- Enhanced the magazine's digital presence, doubling submissions for the subsequent issue through targeted communications and outreach.
- Balanced technical rigor with creative accessibility in editorial and social media content, ensuring alignment with the magazine's mission.
