## Description

As a personal project, I created a 29-page concept of operations (ConOps) featuring resources for navigating technical standards in generative AI. It applies governance frameworks to widely taught concepts in computer science and machine learning, such as tokens and transformers.

By framing the contents as a player's manual, the document leverages prior knowledge of games to facilitate knowledge transfer about AI. It also remains politically neutral: it does not call for or critique either regulatory or deregulatory approaches, and instead emphasizes the voluntary nature of standards.

Additionally, this ConOps applies two forms of reasoning, first-principles reasoning and analogy-based reasoning, to help AI professionals create ethical mental models of their work.

## Highlights

- Authored a detailed guide that synthesizes complex concepts into accessible and actionable content.
- Developed visual aids and workflows to illustrate technical processes and enhance usability.
- Addressed emerging industry needs by outlining best practices for ethical and practical AI development.
