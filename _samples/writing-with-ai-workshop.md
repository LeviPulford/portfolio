## Description

At Amherst College, I co-facilitated a staff-led workshop titled "An Aspiring Ornithologist and a Stochastic Parrot Walk into a Writing Center" during the 2024 AI in the Liberal Arts (AILA) undergraduate research conference.

The workshop offered observations on student agency and AI in writing before inviting participants to explore the impact of artificial intelligence on writing. Activities included creating imaginative documents and data visualizations to identify opportunities and challenges when integrating AI into the writing process.

The workshop also highlighted interdisciplinary insights into how AI reshapes writing pedagogies, practices, and the evolving relationship between humans and technology.

## Highlights

- Designed and facilitated interactive activities that encouraged critical and creative thinking about AI in writing.
- Engaged an interdisciplinary audience in discussions that bridged liberal arts, pedagogy, and artificial intelligence.
- Co-created imaginative resources with participants, including data visualizations and collaborative documents, to capture workshop insights.
