## Description

As part of the capstone project for the University of Washington's Certificate in Professional Technical Writing, I collaborated on a comparative usability study of two popular note-taking applications, Notion and Obsidian. Our team of five UX researchers evaluated onboarding workflows, user satisfaction, and interface design, grounding recommendations in data analysis.

I contributed across UX, content, and visual strategy roles by conducting secondary research (including Nielsen Norman Group resources) to inform content strategy; developing user and product manager personas to align usability with business impact; translating research insights into actionable recommendations; and producing interactive UI breakdowns, attention graphs, and visual workflows to clarify user journeys and interface demands.

As our team's chief calm technology advocate, drawing on Amber Case, I focused on low-friction and ambient user experience principles. In parallel, I applied ideas from Alexandra Mack's work on stakeholder communication to better frame risk and align recommendations with organizational priorities as well as user needs.
