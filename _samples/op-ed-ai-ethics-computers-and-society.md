## Description

I was invited by the chair of the ACM special interest group Computers and Society (SIGCAS) to contribute a quick-take op-ed for the September 2023 newsletter. My piece, titled "'All Watched Over By Machines': AI Ethics, Surveillance, and Pluralism," explores the social and ethical consequences of AI and surveillance technologies while advocating for pluralistic approaches to technological governance.

This work reflects SIGCAS's mission to raise awareness about the societal impact of technology and translates complex ethical issues into an accessible format for a broad technical readership.

## Highlights

- Solicited to write an op-ed for a respected ACM publication, demonstrating recognition of my expertise in AI ethics and communication.
- Engaged an interdisciplinary audience of computer scientists, ethicists, and policymakers with accessible yet nuanced discussion.
- Addressed critical ethical challenges at the intersection of AI, surveillance, and social diversity, aligning with SIGCAS's mission.
